# Setup Spack in GitHub Actions

Set up the [Spack package manager](https://github.com/spack/spack) with a default build cache to
speed up your actions.

## Example: basic setup

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - name: Set up Spack
      uses: spack/setup-spack@v2
      with:
        ref: develop      # Spack version (examples: develop, releases/v0.21)
        buildcache: true  # Configure oci://ghcr.io/spack/github-actions-buildcache
        color: true       # Force color output (SPACK_COLOR=always)
        path: spack       # Where to clone Spack
    - run: spack install python
```

When `buildcache: true` is set, binaries from https://github.com/spack/github-actions-buildcache
are used. For available software, [see here](https://github.com/spack/github-actions-buildcache/blob/main/spack.yaml).

**Note**: when using the build cache with Spack v0.21 and below, the following flag is
required:

```
spack install --no-check-signature
```

This flag is no longer required in Spack v0.22.

## Example: shell support

If you want to use shell-aware commands such as `spack env activate` and `spack load`,
use either `shell: spack-bash {0}` or `shell: spack-sh {0}` in your action:

```yaml
- name: Shell example
  shell: spack-bash {0}
  run: |
    spack env activate .
    spack env status
```

These "shells" are small wrappers that run `. setup-env.sh` before executing your script.

## Example: caching your own binaries for public repositories

When you need to install packages not available in the default build cache, you can build them
once and then cache them on GitHub Packages.

The easiest way to do so is to create a `spack.yaml` environment in the root of your git
repository:

```yaml
spack:
  view: /opt/view
  specs:
  - python@3.11

  config:
    install_tree:
      root: /opt/spack
      padded_length: 128

  packages:
    all:
      require: 'target=x86_64_v3'

  mirrors:
    local-buildcache:
      url: oci://ghcr.io/<username>/spack-buildcache
      signed: false
```

Then configure an action like this:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    permissions:
      packages: write
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Spack
      uses: spack/setup-spack@v2
    
    - name: Install
      run: spack -e . install --no-check-signature

    - name: Run
      shell: spack-bash
      run: |
        spack env activate .
        python3 -c 'print("hello world")'

    - name: Push packages and update index
      run: |
        spack -e . mirror set --push --oci-username ${{ github.actor }} --oci-password "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" local-buildcache
        spack -e . buildcache push --base-image ubuntu:22.04 --update-index local-buildcache
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
```

## Example: caching your own binaries for private repositories

When your local build cache is stored in a private GitHub package,
you need to specify the OCI credentials already *before* `spack concretize`.
This is because Spack needs to fetch the index of the build cache. Also, remember to
remove the `--push` flag from `spack mirror set`, since fetching needs
credentials too:

```yaml
    steps:
    - name: Login
      run: spack -e . mirror set --oci-username ${{ github.actor }} --oci-password "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" local-buildcache

    - name: Concretize
      run: spack -e . concretize

    - name: Install
      run: spack -e . install --no-check-signature

    - name: Push packages and update index
      run: spack -e . buildcache push --base-image ubuntu:22.04 --update-index local-buildcache
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
```

From a security perspective, notice that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is exposed to every
subsequent job step. (This is no different from `docker login`, which also likes
to store credentials in the home directory.)
